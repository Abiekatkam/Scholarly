            The box sat on the desk next to the computer. It had arrived earlier
            in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier. She
            didn't who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been.
            As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would
            completely change her life. There wasn't a whole lot more that could
            be done. It had become a wait-and-see situation with the final
            results no longer in her control. That didn't stop her from trying
            to control the situation. She demanded that things be done as she
            desperately tried to control what couldn't be.

              driving but couldn't see a thing in front of him. He knew he
              should stop, but the road was narrow so if he did, it would be
              right in the center of the road. He was sure that another car
              would end up rear-ending him, so he continued forward despite the
              lack of visibility. This was an unwise move.
